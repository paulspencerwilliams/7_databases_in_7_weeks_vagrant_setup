7 databases in 7 weeks vagrant setup
====================================

This repo contains Vagrant files and associated provisioning scripts to create Vagrant VMs for each database withing the [Seven databases in seven weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/rwdata/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks) Prag Prog book. 

There's [another](https://github.com/codingbynumbers/seven-databases) (most likely better) repo I'd recomment people try, but I'm keeping mine just in case;)
